      <description>An IPAM solution isn&amp;rsquo;t very useful unless it accurately reflects the state of your network. The discovery features in NIOS have always been one of the great benefits of having Infoblox DDI. Network Insight and NetMRI focus on discovery of network gear and what&amp;rsquo;s connected to it. The vDiscovery feature adds the ability to discover virtual infrastructure in both public and private cloud environments. All of these working together can give you a super accurate picture of what exists on your network&amp;hellip;as long as all your gear is supported.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to setup an HTTPS website in the past couple years, you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely heard of Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt which is arguably the largest public certificate authority in the world. Not only are their certificates free, the entire ordering and renewal process can be completely automated using a recently finalized protocol standard known as ACME (RFC 8555).
But there are endless apps and services other than HTTP based web sites that can also use TLS certificates.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.12.0. The Set-PAOrder function now has -DnsPlugin and -PluginArgs parameters which should make it easier to change DNS providers and/or provider parameters without needing to wait for a certificate renewal. The BouncyCastle library has been updated to the latest 1.8.5 version and the DLL file is using a non-standard name to avoid conflicts with other software that uses BouncyCastle and chooses to install the DLL into the .</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.11.0. The Install-PACertificate function now has optional parameters that allow you to specify the Windows certificate store location and name in case the defaults (LocalMachine\My) aren&amp;rsquo;t what you need. You can also use the -NotExportable switch to mark the certificate as non-exportable. There&amp;rsquo;s also a new function called Revoke-PAAuthorization which is mostly useful for testing a new configuration. It allows you to revoke one or more existing authorizations associated with an account so that when you generate a new certificate, the ACME server will require a full re-validation for those names.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.10.0. There&amp;rsquo;s a critical fix in this version for a problem introduced by a recent change in Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s ACME implementation that breaks renewals. A new DNS plugin for HurricaneElectric was added and the Azure plugin now supports certificate based authentication in addition to the existing methods. There&amp;rsquo;s also additional guidance in the tutorial on renewals and deployment.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.9.0. There&amp;rsquo;s a new DNS plugin for UnoEuro thanks to a user submission. The Cloudflare plugin was also updated to support limited use tokens that don&amp;rsquo;t have edit permissions to all zones on an account.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub. Installation instructions are in the Readme.
Changelog  Added new DNS plugin UnoEuro (Thanks @OrKarstoft) Fix for Cloudflare plugin not working properly when limited scope token didn&amp;rsquo;t have at least read permissions to all zones on an account.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-IBCLI release, version 1.3.0. It adds new functions called Get-IBCLIApacheCert and Set-IBCLIApacheCert which wrap the set apache_https_cert command added in NIOS 8.4. What&amp;rsquo;s funny is that the only reason I found out about the command is because of a problem I ran into while testing Posh-IBWAPI&amp;rsquo;s new file upload functions.
The file I was trying to upload was a certificate for the web UI and I figured my test procedure would involve uploading my cert and then re-generating a self-signed cert before repeating the test.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.8.0. Set-PAOrder now supports modifying some order properties that don&amp;rsquo;t require generating a new order such as FriendlyName, PfxPass, and the Install switch. If the order has already been completed, changes to FriendlyName and PfxPass will generate new versions of the associated PFX files with the updated values. But changes to the Install switch will only affect future renewals. The GoDaddy plugin will no longer fail on large accounts with more than 100 domains.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.7.0. In addition to some miscellaneous bug fixes, Submit-Renewal now has an optional -PluginArgs parameter for cases when you need to specify new values for a plugin but don&amp;rsquo;t want to create a whole new order from scratch. This is useful if your credentials change or if the type of credential you&amp;rsquo;re using is purposefully short-lived.

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-IBWAPI release, version 3.1.0. There is now an -OverrideTransferHost switch in Send-IBFile and Receive-IBFile. But to understand what it does requires a bit of explanation on how file transfers work under the hood with the Infoblox WAPI. Any given file transfer (up or down) is a 3-step process that can be generalized as follows.
 Inform WAPI that you want to do a file transfer and it returns a token and a URL to actually transfer against.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.6.0. This one has a bunch of new stuff including new plugins for Domeneshop, Dreamhost, EasyDNS, and freedns.afraid.org. The other big addition is a new function called Invoke-HttpChallengeListener which can be super handy for people doing HTTP challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a self-contained webserver that will respond to requests for the HTTP challenges in your order so you don&amp;rsquo;t have manually deal with making the challenge files available.</description>

      <title>Auditing Active Directory Passwords With PwnedPassCheck</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I introduced a new PowerShell module called PwnedPassCheck. It can be used to check passwords and hashes against a list of over half a billion compromised passwords exposed in data breaches thanks to Troy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s incredibly useful haveibeenpwned.com. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to use the module in conjunction with Michael Grafnetter&amp;rsquo;s amazing DSInternals module to quickly audit existing passwords in Active Directory against the compromised list.</description>

      <description>Troy Hunt&amp;rsquo;s incredibly useful haveibeenpwned.com is a great way to check whether your email address and other personal information was exposed in a data breach. But it also allows you to separately check if a specific password was exposed in a breach. As of version 5, the data set contains over half a billion compromised passwords and the number of times they&amp;rsquo;ve been seen in data breaches. My PwnedPassCheck module lets you query that data easily via PowerShell.</description>

      <title>Workaround For AD PSDrive Bug In Server 2019</title>

      <description>TL;DR Until Microsoft fixes the bug with the AD PSDrive provider, use the fully qualified PSPath to the object instead of the &amp;ldquo;AD:&amp;rdquo; PSDrive path like this:
$DN = (Get-ADUser jdoe).distinguishedName $objectPath = &amp;#34;Microsoft.ActiveDirectory.Management.dll\ActiveDirectory:://RootDSE/$DN&amp;#34; Get-Acl -Path $objectPath The Story I was browsing r/PowerShell recently and came across a thread from someone who had run into a PowerShell bug after upgrading to Windows Server 2019 (1809). The user was attempting to run Get-Acl against an AD object using the object&amp;rsquo;s distinguished name like this:</description>

      <title>Infoblox and MS Management Permissions</title>

      <description>The NIOS documentation lacks great instructions for granting least-privilege access to use the various MS Management components. As a former Active Directory admin, that bugs me because people get frustrated and end up giving service accounts Domain Admin permissions just to get things working. This post will lay out the necessary permissions for each component and provide PowerShell examples on how to apply them easily.
Warning: I&amp;rsquo;ve tested these permissions and examples against NIOS 8.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.5.0. This one has an important fix due to a recent change in Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s ACME implementation which now more strictly adheres to the recently finalized RFC 8555 spec. The Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt change is only on the staging server at the moment, but it will likely move to production soon and it breaks account creation on all previous versions of Posh-ACME.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-IBWAPI release, version 3.0.0. It has only been two days since 2.0.0, but I goofed and shipped 2.0.0 with some breaking changes that I ended up reverting. The biggest feature of the release is the new file upload/download wrappers, Send-IBFile and Recieve-IBFile. They allow you to more easily do things like upload a certificate or download a grid backup and fill a functionality gap that has been bugging me since 1.</description>
