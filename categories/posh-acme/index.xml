      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 4.0.0. This is a huge personal win for me that took far longer than I had originally intended. So I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to finally get it out the door.
HTTP Plugins The biggest long overdue change is that the plugin system can now support http-0 based challenges and the architecture has been revamped such that adding support for additional challenge types should be significantly easier.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.20.0. The Azure plugin has been enhanced in this release thanks to @InKahootz and now supports targeting additional Azure cloud environments that support specific countries or governments. There are also some fixes for the Simply plugin.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub. Installation instructions are in the Readme.
Changelog  Azure plugin now supports other Azure cloud environments via the AZEnvironment parameter.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.19.0. There is a new DNS plugin for Simply which is ultimately just a clone of the existing UnoEuro plugin. The provider changed their name and their API endpoint, but it should function the same. DNSPod also changed their API recently and the plugin has been updated to account for those changes, but users will need to create and set an updated API key in their configs in order for renewals to continue working.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.18.0. The highlight of this release is a plugin for DuckDNS. DuckDNS is a free, but troublesome provider to work with because their API only allows for a single TXT record to exist at a time. That means if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get a cert that has more than one name in it, such as example.com and www.example.com, you need to publish and validate each TXT record separately instead of publishing both records and validating them at the same time.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME.Deploy release, version 1.2.0. There is now a Set-IISFTPCertificate function. It requires the same WebAdministration module the other IIS function does and has been tested on Windows Server 2019, but will likely work against earlier versions as well. In addition to updating the cert, it can also be used to change other SSL related FTP parameters like Control Channel Policy, Data Channel Policy, and whether to use 128-bit encryption.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.17.0. The highlight of this release is the ability to import or export the private key associated with an ACME account. When creating a new account or performing a key rollover for an existing account, Posh-ACME will normally generate a new random private key automatically. But you now have the option to import an existing key instead of having one generated. It works like this:</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.16.0. The highlight of this release is Preferred Chain support which is an advanced but important feature with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s impending root transition. When you download a certificate from an ACME server, you also get the issuing chain with that certificate. But for certificate authorities with complex issuance hierarchies, the ACME server may have multiple valid hierarchies to choose from. This new feature allows you to specify which chain to use based on the Common Name of an issuing CA in the chain.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME.Deploy release, version 1.1.0. There is now a Set-ExchangeCertificate function thanks to Erik Nemchik (@nemchik). It requires the Microsoft.Exchange.Management.PowerShell snap-in and has been tested successfully against Exchange 2019, but may work against earlier versions as well.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub. Installation instructions are in the Readme.

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.15.0. The big news in this release is External Account Binding (EAB) support which widens Posh-ACME&amp;rsquo;s compatibility with certificate authorities other than Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt. Sectigo, for example, offers paid certificates and ACME compatible endpoints. However, creating the ACME account requires linking it against an existing Sectigo account using new parameters in New-PAAccount. These parameters are a standard part of the ACME protocol, but optional to implement by a certificate authority.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.14.0. There&amp;rsquo;s now a Hetzner plugin thanks to a submission by Franz Mueller (@derguterat). The RFC2136 has an important fix when using it with names other than the root domain. The Google DNS plugin and the Azure usage guide also got a couple fixes.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub. Installation instructions are in the Readme.

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.13.0. There are a whole bunch of new plugins in this release and a whopping four of them were submitted by Anton Samsonov (@WiZaRd31337). One of the other big additions is the long-awaited RFC2136 plugin which utilizes BIND&amp;rsquo;s nsupdate utility to perform dynamic DNS updates. If you&amp;rsquo;re on Windows, definitely check the usage guide if you plan to use this because you likely need to download and install the nsupdate prerequisite.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to setup an HTTPS website in the past couple years, you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely heard of Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt which is arguably the largest public certificate authority in the world. Not only are their certificates free, the entire ordering and renewal process can be completely automated using a recently finalized protocol standard known as ACME (RFC 8555).
But there are endless apps and services other than HTTP based web sites that can also use TLS certificates.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new module called Posh-ACME.Deploy. It&amp;rsquo;s an optional companion module for Posh-ACME that provides a set of functions to make it easier to deploy the certificates you create.
Deploying certificates is never as simple as you want it to be particularly on Windows. Some apps want PEM files in a folder referenced in a config file. Others reference them from the registry. Some need the certificates in a Windows certificate store, but they might be configured based on thumbprint via WMI.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.12.0. The Set-PAOrder function now has -DnsPlugin and -PluginArgs parameters which should make it easier to change DNS providers and/or provider parameters without needing to wait for a certificate renewal. The BouncyCastle library has been updated to the latest 1.8.5 version and the DLL file is using a non-standard name to avoid conflicts with other software that uses BouncyCastle and chooses to install the DLL into the .</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.11.0. The Install-PACertificate function now has optional parameters that allow you to specify the Windows certificate store location and name in case the defaults (LocalMachine\My) aren&amp;rsquo;t what you need. You can also use the -NotExportable switch to mark the certificate as non-exportable. There&amp;rsquo;s also a new function called Revoke-PAAuthorization which is mostly useful for testing a new configuration. It allows you to revoke one or more existing authorizations associated with an account so that when you generate a new certificate, the ACME server will require a full re-validation for those names.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.10.0. There&amp;rsquo;s a critical fix in this version for a problem introduced by a recent change in Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s ACME implementation that breaks renewals. A new DNS plugin for HurricaneElectric was added and the Azure plugin now supports certificate based authentication in addition to the existing methods. There&amp;rsquo;s also additional guidance in the tutorial on renewals and deployment.

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.9.0. There&amp;rsquo;s a new DNS plugin for UnoEuro thanks to a user submission. The Cloudflare plugin was also updated to support limited use tokens that don&amp;rsquo;t have edit permissions to all zones on an account.
Updated versions can be found in the PowerShell Gallery or GitHub. Installation instructions are in the Readme.

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.8.0. Set-PAOrder now supports modifying some order properties that don&amp;rsquo;t require generating a new order such as FriendlyName, PfxPass, and the Install switch. If the order has already been completed, changes to FriendlyName and PfxPass will generate new versions of the associated PFX files with the updated values. But changes to the Install switch will only affect future renewals. The GoDaddy plugin will no longer fail on large accounts with more than 100 domains.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.7.0. In addition to some miscellaneous bug fixes, Submit-Renewal now has an optional -PluginArgs parameter for cases when you need to specify new values for a plugin but don&amp;rsquo;t want to create a whole new order from scratch. This is useful if your credentials change or if the type of credential you&amp;rsquo;re using is purposefully short-lived.

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.6.0. This one has a bunch of new stuff including new plugins for Domeneshop, Dreamhost, EasyDNS, and freedns.afraid.org. The other big addition is a new function called Invoke-HttpChallengeListener which can be super handy for people doing HTTP challenges. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a self-contained webserver that will respond to requests for the HTTP challenges in your order so you don&amp;rsquo;t have manually deal with making the challenge files available.</description>

      <description>Just shipped a new Posh-ACME release, version 3.5.0. This one has an important fix due to a recent change in Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt&amp;rsquo;s ACME implementation which now more strictly adheres to the recently finalized RFC 8555 spec. The Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt change is only on the staging server at the moment, but it will likely move to production soon and it breaks account creation on all previous versions of Posh-ACME.
